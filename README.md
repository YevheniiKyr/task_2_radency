# Task 
Task is to create a notes app in JS as a web app.

Users can add, edit and remove notes.

List of notes is displayed in a form of table (HTML representation may vary: table, divs etc).

The columns are name, time of creation, note content, note category, etc.

Categories are predefined: “Task”, “Random Thought”, “Idea”.

Notes in the table should also display a list of dates mentioned in this note as a separate column. For example, for a note “I’m gonna have a dentist appointment on the 3/5/2021, I moved it from 5/5/2021” the dates column is “3/5/2021, 5/5/2021”.

Users can archive notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.

There should also be a summary table which counts notes by categories: separately for active and archived. The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.

There is no need to implement data storage. Simply create a JS variable which stores the data and prepopulate it with 7 notes so that they are shown when the page is reloaded
